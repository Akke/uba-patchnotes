Bug Fixes:
- Fixed Sand Kings Ultimate having a channel time
- Fixed edible aegis, should now work like a normal aegis (does not stack with any other type of reincarnation, sadly)
- Fixed edible gem (unfortunately it does not detect wards)
- Fixed Roshans stats being bugged this entire time (he was never meant to be that squishy)
- Fixed catchup system counting disconnected players
- Fixed attack animations being slightly de-synced on bosses (roshan was affected the worst)
- Fixed Sonic Cataclysm pushing in the wrong direction

- Fixed poor scaling on Trident of the Depths

- Fixed level 2/3 Trident of the Depths not working

Bosses:
- Roshan no longer drops any charged essence, but has a guaranteed chance to drop an aghanims scepter or shard (50/50 for which one drops)
