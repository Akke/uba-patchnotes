Bug Fixes:
- Fixed Sand Kings Ultimate having a channel time
- Fixed edible aegis, should now work like a normal aegis (does not stack with any other type of reincarnation, sadly)
- Fixed Gem (unfortunately it does not detect wards)
- Fixed Roshans stats being bugged this entire time (he was never meant to be that squishy)

Items:
- Reduced cost of edible gem from 5000 > 2500

Bosses:
- Roshan no longer drops any charged essence, but has a guaranteed chance to drop an aghanims scepter or shard (50/50 for which one drops)
