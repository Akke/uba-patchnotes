Bug Fixes:
- Fixed Huskar boss burning spear not working 

Bosses:
- Bosses are now considered as immovable objects 
- All Bosses magic immunity decreased to 25% (including mid boss)
- Boss AI has been improved
  - Changing attack target is now much smoother than before (before it would have a slight delay before attacking the new target)
  - Will change attack target if the current target becomes invulnerable or untargetable in any way (e.g. manta phasing, astral prison, etc.)
  - Will no longer keep chasing the attack target if they run out of the attack zone
  - Attack targets are now chosen based on how close they are to the boss, meaning it will target illusions, units, etc, instead of always focusing your hero
  - Will no longer cast abilities as soon as target becomes visible, but rather has a small delay before casting now

Windranger:
- Focus Fire cooldown decreased from 20 15 10 > 10 8 6

Map:
- Changed the middle zone area to reflect more on the new boss
