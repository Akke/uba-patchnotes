Bosses:
Sacred Warrior:
- Burning Spear is now dispellable
- No longer drops rune of strength

Roshan:
- Now has a 50% chance at any level to drop either an aghanims scepter, aghanims shard or a refresher shard.

Bug Fixes:
- Fixed bosses going above their intended max level
- Fixed bosses not dropping the correct amount of charged essence per level
- Fixed Akasha's level being one level too high when scaling per player
- Fixed Lantern of Perish not giving stats
