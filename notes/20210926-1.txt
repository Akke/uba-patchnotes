Neutral Items:
- Buffed all neutral items
- Enabled ballista and illusionists cape

Items:
Ultra Blink:
- Increased explosion attribute scaling from 100 125 150% > 150 175 200%

Manta Style:
- Updated the tooltip to be more accurate

Black King Blade:
- Now applies a hard dispell on use

Curse Bearer:
- Separated the initial debuff amount and the decaying slow into two separate passives
  - New: Cold Attacks is now a separate passive that works on any unit (illusions, etc, wont apply it still, like skadi)
  - New: Cursed Affliction is now a separate passive with a 15 second cooldown (the debuff technically lasts for 10 seconds, so this is really a 5 second cooldown)
- Cursed Afflictions can now only be removed by a hard dispell
- The healing prevention from the final explosion now ignores magic immunity (but the damage does not)
