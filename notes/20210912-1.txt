Bug Fix:
- Spiked Armor not sharing cooldown with Blademail
- Geminate Attack only scales to 4 now because it doesn't work at lvl 7
- Fixed Akasha not scaling her stats per player
- Fixed Sacred Warrior burning spear cast range being less than his attack range/aggro range
- Fixed minions randomly aggroing everyone nearby when they spawn

Gameplay:
Bosses:
- Pure damage taken is now converted to physical damage
- Can no longer take more than 1% of their max health as damage from any damage instance

Balance:
Akasha:
- Reduced base armor from 100 to 50
- Increased BaT from 0.3 to 0.2
