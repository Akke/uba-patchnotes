Bug Fixes:
- Fixed Akasha's magic immunity effect lasting for the entire duration of Sonic Cataclysm

Akasha:
- Her abilities now have a global cooldown in addition to their own cooldowns
- She can no longer move while preparing to cast an ability
- Now has cast time indicators (red circles) that warns player of what's about to happen
- Added unique voicelines that triggers on various events
- Movement speed lowered from 625 > 325
- Health increased from 500k > 1m
- Now has 3 stages depending on her health, which changes her appearance and unlocks more of her skills, making her harder as she advances through them:
  • Stage 1 (QoP): >66% health
  • Stage 2 (Blue Arcana QoP): <66% health
  • Stage 3 (Red Arana QoP): <33% health
